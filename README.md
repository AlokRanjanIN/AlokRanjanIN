# 👋 Hi, I’m **Alok Ranjan Singh**  
**Full‑Stack Data Scientist & Generative AI Engineer**

---

## 🌟 What I Build  
I specialize in designing and deploying intelligent systems that transform multi-modal data into actionable insights:

- **Generative AI & Large Language Models**: Fine-tuning LLMs for content generation, Q&A, conversational agents (e.g. GPT‑based pipelines).  
- **Computer Vision & Vision‑Language Models**: End-to-end solutions for image classification, object detection, and multi-modal understanding.  
- **NLP & Speech‑to‑Text**: Transformer‑based NLP for multilingual text, summarization, and transcribed pipelines for Indian and global languages.  
- **MLOps & Model Deployment**: Containerized and scalable AI services via Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms (CI/CD, monitoring, infra).  
- **Data Engineering & SQL**: Efficient data ingestion, ETL pipelines, and optimized querying tailored for AI workflows.
